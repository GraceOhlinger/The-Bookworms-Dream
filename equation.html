            <h1>The Soulmate Equation</h1>
            <h2>by Christina Lauren</h2>
            <hx>$7.50</hx>
            <br>
                <p>Single mom Jessica Davis is a data and statics wizard, but no amount of numbers crunching can convience her to step back into the dating world. Jess has been left behind too often to feel comfortable letting anyone in: Her mother disappeared when she was six, leaving her to be raised by her grandparents, and her ex decided he wasn't "father material" before their daughter, Juno, was even born. Jess holds her loved ones close, but working constantly to stay afloat is hard...and lonely. But then she hears about GeneticAlly, a new DNA-based matchmaking company that promises to change dating forever. Finding a soulmate through data? The reliability of numbers: This Jess understands.</p>
                
                <p>At least, she thought she did, until her test shows an unheard-of 98 percent compatibility with GeneticAlly's founder, Dr. River Pena, a stuck-up, stubborn man who is without a doubt not her soulmate. But GeneticAlly has a proposition: Get to know him and we'll pay you. Jess---who is barely making ends meet---is in no position to turn it down, despite her skepticism about the project and her dislike for River. As the pair are dragged from one event to the next as the "Diamond Match" that could launch GenticAlly's valuation sky-high, Jess begins to realize that there might be more to the scientist---and the science behind a soulmate---than she thought.</p>

                <p>Funny, warm, and full of heart, "The Soulmate Equation" proves that the delicate balance between fate and choice can never be calculated.</p>
