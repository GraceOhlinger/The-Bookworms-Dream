            <h1>Emily Dickinson - Collected Poems</h1>
            <hx>$9.00</hx>
            <br>
                <p>After attending Amherst Institute and Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, Emily Dickinson retired to her fatherâ€™s house and rarely descended from her room. She wrote poetry thoughout her adult life, but of the nearly eighteen hundred poems we know about, only seven were published in her lifetime, all anonymously, and most surreptitously by friends who wished to see them in print. In 1862 she sent four poems to The Alantic Monthly. Their rejection led her to believe that the public did not care for her poetry, and she never attempted to publish anything more. It would be up to later generations to discover her poetic genius.</p>
                
                <p>The themes of Dickinson's poetry are as large as her physical world was small. Her verses, mostly brief and tightly ordered, are usually concerned with such massive subjects as fear, love, death, immortality, and man's relationship to nature. Her collected works show the breadth of her tragic vision and her deep understanding of the human condition. Her stature in the world of letters continues to increase with time. She has long been considered one of America's greatest poets. </p>
